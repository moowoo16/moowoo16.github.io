    <h1> Hi, I'm Maggie! (she/her)</h1>
    <h2>I'm a senior majoring in Finance and minoring in CTD </h2>
    <h3>I am a beginner with HTML so I am looking forward to learning about it during this class!</h3>
    <p>I'm from New Jersey! I have a bunny named Moo (pictured above) and he is the love of my life. Right now I live in Boulder with my 8 roomates and we have fun everyday.
        Some of my hobbies include hiking, cooking, bartending, going to concerts, weight lifting, collecting trinkets, hanging with my friends, and being silly. 
        My birthday is May 22nd and my favoite color is purple and my favorite season is the summer because I love the beach.
    Ok see ya have a great day! </p>
